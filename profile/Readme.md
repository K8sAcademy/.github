## Self-Paced Courses

Learn the core concepts of Docker containers and Kubernetes. Perfect for developers, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineers and I.T. Pros. No previous experience with containers or Kubernetes is needed. After using containers and Kubernetes locally, you'll deploy them in the Cloud by using managed Kubernetes and other container services.

Not just videos! An important part of our training is dedicated to building, managing and deploying containers on Kubernetes. In each module, you'll find a series of detailed exercises and tasks in order to put into practice what you just learned. No coding experience is needed.
