## Message from your instructor

Hi everyone,

Kubernetes Academy Online is now closed. I have been offered a dream job as a course and content writer for a large company in the Kubernetes landscape. This is why I closed Kubernetes Academy Online. 

The Fundamentals course is available on the FreeCodeCamp Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTp5xUtcalw

The lab files for all the courses are available but are not maintained and won't be updated.

Thanks to all who bought a course, attended my public or private classes, or bought me a coffee to thank me for the free Fundamentals course. 

Have fun in your learning journey,

Guy Barrette
