## Message from your instructor

Hi everyone,

I have been offered a dream job as a course and content writer for a large company in the Kubernetes landscape. This is why Iâ€™m closing Kubernetes Academy Online. 

Students who previously registered for a course or bought one will have access until February 28, 2023. After that, the site will shut down completely. So put your learning hat on, set some time to focus and learn, and make sure to complete the course you registered for so you too can become a Kubernetes Ninja!

Thanks to all who bought a course, attended my public or private classes, or bought me a coffee to thank me for the free Fundamentals course. 

Have fun in your learning journey,
Guy Barrette
